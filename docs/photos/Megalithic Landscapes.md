I am looking at my collection of photographs of standing stones and stone circles in the UK.  These photographs were taken as part of a project to document them in the landscape. The photographs were taken between 1973 and 1985.

The photographs were taken with film and eventually scanned for use on the web site. Images are stored on Flickr.
